## ðŸ’¡ Self-Introduction

Iâ€™m a student at HSE Nizhny Novgorod studying Applied Mathematics and Information Science.
Iâ€™ve started learning frontend development â€” HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git â€” mostly through practice and online courses like RS School.
Iâ€™m not experienced yet, but Iâ€™m eager to learn, solve problems step by step, and build things that work.
I like when code is clear and easy to understand â€” and Iâ€™m working on getting better every day.
